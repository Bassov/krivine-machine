## Building the project
In order to build project [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)

Than in the root of the project just write in comand-line
```
stack build
```
Than you will see long output, but at the last stage there would be information about executables
```
Installing executable krivine-machine-exe in /Users/alex/work/krivine-machine/.stack-work/install/x86_64-osx/lts-10.4/8.2.2/bin
```
Using this path executable could be found and than launched

To use repl just run
```
stack repl
```
